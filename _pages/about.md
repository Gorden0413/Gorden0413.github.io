Hi! I'm Kuang-Ming Chen (陳光銘), currently a graduate student at the University of Washington, where I work in the [Information Processing Lab](https://ipl-uw.github.io/) under the supervision of Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang. My current research focuses on **Vision-Language Models (VLMs) Understanding**, particularly how to align and interpret multimodal information effectively.

Before this, I completed my undergraduate studies at National Taiwan University, advised by Prof. Hung-yi Lee. My previous work involved **training pipelines for Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **self-supervised learning for speech models**, with a strong interest in making foundation models more accessible and efficient for real-world applications.

You’ll find information about my publications, research projects, teaching experiences, and more throughout this site.

Thanks for visiting!
