Welcome! I'm Kuang-Ming Chen (陳光銘), currently a graduate student at the University of Washington, where I work in the [Information Processing Lab](http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/ip/) under the supervision of Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang. My current research focuses on **Vision-Language Models (VLMs) Understanding**, particularly how to align and interpret multimodal information effectively.

Before this, I completed my undergraduate studies at National Taiwan University, advised by Prof. Hung-yi Lee. My previous work involved **training pipelines for Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **self-supervised learning for speech models**, with a strong interest in making foundation models more accessible and efficient for real-world applications.

This website is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), built with Jekyll and hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). You’ll find information about my publications, research projects, teaching experiences, and more throughout this site.

A data-driven personal website
======
This site separates content (like publications, talks, and blog posts) from design. Each content item is written in structured markdown and stored in version-controlled repositories. This makes it easy to update, automate, and repurpose your research information.

I’m also working on automating my publication/talk list using structured data (CSV/JSON) and Jupyter notebooks, following workflows outlined in the original [Academic Pages repo](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

Getting started with your own site?
======
1. Fork the [template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)
2. Customize `_config.yml` and navigation files
3. Add your markdown files under directories like `_publications`, `_talks`, and `_posts`
4. Host it for free on GitHub Pages!

For more details, check the [setup guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/) or explore the [Minimal Mistakes theme documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).

Thanks for visiting!
