Welcome! I'm **Kuang-Ming Chen**, a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington. This website serves as my **personal academic homepage**, a **portfolio for job applications**, and a **platform to showcase my research and projects**.

It is built using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), allowing easy updates and open access to my academic contributions. Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications), [talks](/talks), [teaching](/teaching), [blog](/blog), and [CV](/cv).

### A data-driven personal website

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages separates the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of this website are stored in structured markdown files, while theme files control how that content is rendered. Every time an update is pushed to the GitHub repository, GitHub Pages automatically builds and hosts a static HTML version.

This approach mimics the functionality of dynamic CMS platforms like WordPress but with significantly lower overhead and greater flexibility. Moreover, all academic content — including publications, talks, and a dynamically-generated CV — remains secure, portable, and script-accessible. For example, [this notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) visualizes where talks have been given using structured data from the `_talks` directory.
